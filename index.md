  <h2 class="sq-section-title">About Me</h2>

  <p>
    At the University of Houston, I am a Junior majoring in computer science.
    I have been fascinated by technology and its ability to address complicated issues since I was young.
    Because of this enthusiasm, I decided to study computer science so that I could combine my passion for coding with my aim to
    change the world through cutting-edge software solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, coding is more than simply a hobby; it is my actual passion.
    I get a great deal of satisfaction and excitement from using code to make ideas come to life.
    I regularly push myself to learn new ideas and abilities as I work to increase my knowledge and proficiency in a variety of
    programming languages and technologies.
